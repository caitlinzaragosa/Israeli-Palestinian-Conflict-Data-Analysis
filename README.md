Check out the file in action here:  https://caitlinzaragosa.shinyapps.io/israeli-palestinian-data-analysis/

This project looks at UNHCR and UNRWA Refugee Data along with ACLED Event data regarding both Palestinian and Israeli areas. As someone who studied Arabic in college and traveled to the region, I have a decent understanding of the context in which this data is surrounded by and figured it would be a great opportunity to shed some light on what is happening on the ground thousands of miles away! I am in no way an expert on this topic, but I did want to take a look at what the available data is saying by doing some topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and various visualizations. 

The data used for these analyses are located here:

Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED); acleddata.com

UNHCR Refugee Population Statistics Database; https://www.unrwa.org; https://www.unhcr.org/terms-and-conditions.html
